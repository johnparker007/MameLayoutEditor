# MAME Layout Editor

A minimal, runnable web app scaffold for building a MAME `.lay` layout editor. This project focuses on the foundation only: Vite + React + TypeScript, routing, state management, and a lightweight UI shell.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Current scope

- Basic app shell with header, sidebar, and editor placeholders.
- File open/save flow that stores raw XML and filename in state.
- Placeholder `.lay` parsing module for future expansion.

## Next steps (placeholder)

- Implement real `.lay` parsing and serialization.
- Add layout visualization and editing tools.
- Build asset management and inspector editors.
